# Bowling test example
This example is a ten-pin bowling game, that doesn't work right yet, but the test framework for using mocha and stryker is there :-). Have fun!

## How do I do this?
First, run the first time setup.
```
npm run setup
```

Now you can either run the program (`src/index.js)
```
npm run start
```

Or run the tests
```
npm run test
```

To run the mutation testing, run this
```
npm run test-mutants
```
